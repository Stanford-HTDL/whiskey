Module Documentation: models.py

This module contains the definition of two Pydantic models: `TargetParams` and `MediaParams`. These models are used to define the request payload for the corresponding endpoints in the FastAPI application.

Author:
- Richard Correro (richard@richardcorrero.com)

Dependencies:
- List from typing
- BaseModel, Field from pydantic

Classes:
- TargetParams(BaseModel):
  This class represents the request payload for the "/analyze" endpoint in the FastAPI application.
  It inherits from the `BaseModel` class provided by Pydantic.

  Attributes:
  - start: str | None
    The start month (inclusive) in the format "%Y_%m".
    It is an optional field with a default value of "2023_01".
    The field is validated to have a maximum length of 7 and a minimum length of 7.

  - stop: str | None
    The stop month (exclusive) in the format "%Y_%m".
    It is an optional field with a default value of "2023_02".
    The field is validated to have a maximum length of 7 and a minimum length of 7.

  - target_geojsons: List[str] | None
    A list of GeoJSONs encoded as strings that demarcate the region for analysis.
    It is an optional field with a default value of [geojson_str], where `geojson_str` is a predefined GeoJSON string.
    The field represents multiple GeoJSONs, allowing analysis on multiple regions.

  - bbox_threshold: float
    A value used to determine whether to consider a predicted bounding box as a positive.
    The value must be in the range [0, 1].
    It has a default value of 0.95.

- MediaParams(BaseModel):
  This class represents the request payload for the "/media" endpoint in the FastAPI application.
  It inherits from the `BaseModel` class provided by Pydantic.

  Attributes:
  - start: str | None
    The start month (inclusive) in the format "%Y_%m".
    It is an optional field with a default value of "2022_01".
    The field is validated to have a maximum length of 7 and a minimum length of 7.

  - stop: str | None
    The stop month (exclusive) in the format "%Y_%m".
    It is an optional field with a default value of "2023_01".
    The field is validated to have a maximum length of 7 and a minimum length of 7.

  - target_geojsons: List[str] | None
    A list of GeoJSONs encoded as strings that demarcate the region for which media will be created.
    It is an optional field with a default value of [geojson_str], where `geojson_str` is a predefined GeoJSON string.
    The field represents multiple GeoJSONs, allowing media creation for multiple regions.
